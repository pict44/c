ASSIGNMENT 7(A):-
Problem Statement:-
Full duplex communication between two independent processes. 
First process accepts sentences and writes on one pipe to be read 
by second process and second process counts number of 
characters, number of words and number of lines in accepted 
sentences, writes this output in a text file and writes the contents 
of the file on second pipe to be read by first process and displays 
on standard output.
